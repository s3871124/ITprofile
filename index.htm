<h2> Personal Information </h2>
<img src="Me.jpg" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
<p> My name is Luu Vi Quan, my student number is s3871124, and my email address is s3871124@rmit.edu.vn. I'm from Vietnam, and I’m currently studying at RMIT SAIGON. I can speak two languages, Vietnamese and English. In my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and play soccer as my hobby. </p>

<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<ul>

<li> The reason that I'm mainly interested in IT is its ability to bring everyone closer together by connecting with people all around the world. My interest in IT started way back in my high school days when I took the IT subject at my school. I started getting into IT during one of a speed typing class, and I realized that I could type somewhat faster than my classmates. After that typing class, I began to participate in some IT projects such as learning to edit videos, coding, and doing excel. </li>


<li> I chose to come to RMIT because RMIT is one of the best universities in the world, not just in Vietnam. Along with it, with my experience of studying overseas at Monash University in Melbourne and knowing that RMIT also has their campus in Melbourne, I’m honored and proud to be an RMIT student. </li>


<li> In this course, I hope to study and to get a deeper understanding of the IT world as it would contribute towards my future career. I find networking very interesting,  so I’m hoping I can gain more knowledge about that segment.</li>

</ul>

<h2> Ideal Job </h2>

<li> <a href='https://itviec.com/it-jobs/it-business-analyst-junior-and-senior-fpt-software-0853?lab_feature=employer_job'>https://itviec.com/it-jobs/it-business-analyst-junior-and-senior-fpt-software-0853?lab_feature=employer_job </a>   </li>

<li> The job title that I will apply for after graduating at RMIT University is IT Business Analyst (Junior and Senior). An IT Business Analyst refers to the person that interprets customer material and interacting with them to ensure that requirements are met, and no errors will occur. This position is appealing to me because it allows me to expand my social skills by building relationships with customers and having the ability to solve problems effectively and efficiently.</li>
<li> The job qualifications entail researching and analyzing abilities when it comes to interpreting documents, being fluent in English is essential; having good communication skills and teamwork skills. For senior levels, employees applying must have at least two years of experience of BA in the IT industry as well as the ability to solve problems, willingness to learn new skills, and working under pressure. </li>
<li> As for myself, the skills and qualifications that I currently have are fluent in English, a decent level of communication skills, and I work well in teams. Furthermore, I can solve problems quickly and the willingness to acquire new knowledge and new technologies skills. </li>
<li> Regarding the qualifications and eligibility for my ideal job, I’m currently under-qualified. However, I’m determined to come up with a plan to gain more experience in the IT industry. Firstly, the most crucial step is to graduate from university and attain a Bachelor of IT. Secondly, during my time of finishing university, I might apply for part-time jobs to build my CV. Thirdly, I would want to improve and work on my IT skills, such as getting the grasp of commanding Microsoft Office and the use of Modelling, UML, and Design tools. Once my plan is accomplished, I hope I can get accepted into FPT doing IT Business Analyst.  </li>

</ul>

<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
<ul>

<li> Myers-Briggs Test: The test showed that I’m an Entertainer (ESFP-T), which means I’m an extrovert, outgoing, and social person. </li>
<li> Learning Style Test: The test showed that I’m a tactile, “hands-on” learner, which means I tend to learn better when there is physicality involved. </li>
<li> Big Five Personality Test: This test is based on the five parts of personality, Openness, Conscientious, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN).  My openness level is 48%, my conscientiousness level is 46%, my extraversion level is 60%,  my agreeableness level is 71%, and my neuroticism level is 52%. </li>


</ul>

<p> According to these results, I can agree that some parts of it resemble my personality, but not all of it is accurate. However, with the discovering of my character more in-depth, it shows that I work well in teams and groups. An example of this is my agreeableness is 71%, portraying an image of myself acting harmoniously and coordinating flawlessly with my teammates. Therefore, with all these tests conducted, it will assist me in cooperating with others, especially in group projects, and perform well in my assignment. </p>


<h2> Project Ideas </h2>
<p> My project idea is Facial Expression Recognition (FER), where it can detect a person’s facial expression and show whether the person is feeling happy, sad, shocked, or angry (Huang, Chen, Lv, & Wang, 2019).  Facial expressions play a crucial role in human communication and the exchange process. According to a researcher, Mehrabian (1974) found that 55% of messages relating to feelings and attitudes is in facial expressions. Hence, with the rapid development of advanced technology nowadays, the studies of FER are further explored and implemented by researchers in the fields. FER can be used in multiple areas such as virtual reality, education, human to computer interaction, and entertainment. </p>

<p> As we know, facial expressions are vital in human communication. With the application of Facial Expression Recognition, information and data can be delivered in an unfettered and unbiased way when it comes to emotional responses. Furthermore, FER can be implemented in business operations or video game prototypes. An example of the use of FER in business operations is the market research stage. A well-known research objective that most businesses have to investigate is the customer needs and wants. The previous method is conducted based on the assumption that customers reflect positively or negatively on the product of the business. However, with FER implementation, companies can measure specific and exact facial expressions of emotions by the customers, thus providing more accurate and reliable results. </p>

<p> Facial Expression Recognition is a computer-based system that relies on algorithms to distinguish the emotional states of humans. The process of FER is divided into three main steps. The first step is to detect a person’s face by looking it up through an image or video. Once the face is pinpoint, the next step is recognizing the landmarks on that person’s face, focusing on the shape components and the texture of the skin. Finally, the last step is to classify emotions and facial expressions. Moreover, this refers to the feelings and emotions the person is expressing, and with the emotion classification, we can figure out what their true feelings are. Aside from this, the use of Facial Expression Recognition is useful in video game testing. An example of this would be a video game company that recently designed a new video game, and they want to experiment whether players enjoy their gameplay or not. Therefore, the company chose a group of gamers to try out the new gameplay for a particular time and then supervise the emotions or the behaviors of the players. The response of the players during the gameplay will contribute towards the feedback stage and the stage of finishing the final product.</p>

<p> The software used to analyze facial expression is Noldus FaceReader. FaceReader is an automated system that recognizes facial images, including the six basic human emotions: happy, sad, angry, scared, surprised, and disgusted (Huang, Chen, Lv, & Wang, 2019). This software is very accurate and easy to use, where the accuracy is up to 91% to 100%. Its main output is the results of the person’s facial expression by providing charts and graphs to reveal percentages of the emotions. The FER results are available in both 2D form and 3D. Another type of technology used to run FER is Kaggle, where the creator will come up with their datasets to initiate the FER system.</p>
<p>For Facial Expression Recognition to operate, I must acquire a set of skills and have access to the required software. With the software, I will be able to access the FaceReader Online and still get fast and accurate results. Once I got access to FaceReader Online, I will send the link to the participants so that their facial expressions can be analyzed. During the interviewing of the participants, the actual process will be monitored and stored and is available for review right after the recording. Along with understanding the software, I will develop and work on my interpersonal skills, such as communication skills, teamwork skills, and master the use of Microsoft Office to become proficient in operating my project. </p>
<p> Assuming that my project will come out being successful, it will contribute positively towards business development and their operations. Errors, unpredictability, and untrustworthy results will be prevented and replaced with fast, accurate, and reliable information. Businesses will get a deeper understanding of the customer’s minds and how to meet their wants and needs. Products and services will only satisfy customer expectations, not giving them disappointments and dissatisfaction. With customer satisfaction rising, business reputation will grow, and profitability will be achieved.  I believe with the development of Facial Expression Recognition, and it will benefit the IT industry and business industry to expand and further develop the economy.</p>
